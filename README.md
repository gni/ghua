## Motivation

Quickly verifying the authenticity of a GitHub profile can be a tedious process, requiring multiple clicks to find essential information. This tool was created to solve that problem.

In an environment where spam accounts, impersonation, and manipulated commit histories are a concern, having a rapid way to check a profile's core data is crucial. This tool provides immediate access to key authenticity markers, with a focus on the account creation date (`created_at`) a stable metric that cannot be altered by the user. It streamlines the process of checking if a user is genuinely new or if their profile warrants further scrutiny.

## Features

- **Dual Search:** Look up any user by their unique **username** or **user ID**.
- **Formatted Results:** Instantly view key profile information like Name, Login, User ID, and the account creation date.
- **Raw Data Inspection:** See the complete JSON response from the GitHub API for in-depth, unfiltered analysis.
- **Responsive Design:** Use the tool effectively on any device, from desktop to mobile.
- **Client-Side Operation:** All API calls are made directly from your browser to the GitHub API for privacy and security.
